2. What size character does the supplied font ROM hold? This will be the size of a
“character cell.”

16 vertical, 8 horizontal

3. What is the display’s resolution (visible pixels)?

480x272

4. Using the answers to the above two questions, how many complete character cells can be
displayed in a rectangular grid on the display? How many cells are in each row? Each
column?

60 each row, 17 each column. 60 * 17 = 1020 character cells.

5. How many visible pixels on the display do character cells not cover? These would be
pixels that cannot display a complete character along the edge of the display.

None?

6. Using a grid of power-of-two side lengths, what size grid is needed to hold the data for
this screen-filling array of stored characters? How many cells are unused because of the
power-of-two addressing constraint? For example, a 3x6 grid of characters requires a 4x8
grid of RAM storage for ease of addressing.

Width: floor(log2(60) + 1) = 6
Length: floor(log2(17) + 1) = 5
